/// This intentionally does not expose a constructor, as it is up to the end user to construct
/// this and pass it to a library for use. Thus, the constructor can be runtime-specific, and may
/// vary.
///
/// Tokio's AsyncRead/Write implementations were chosen for the sake of picking something. Like
/// everything else, this is subject to bikeshedding. `std` will have this someday anyways.
///
/// `Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output=T>>>` is used here everywhere for lack of GATs, although someday
/// this can change.
